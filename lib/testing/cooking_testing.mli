(** Define a new test.

    [test n f] defines a new test with name [n] and body [f]. In the test, success is indicated with a result of {! Ok}
   and failure with an error message (or by throwing an exception). *)

val execute_all :
  Accounting.state -> Test.t list -> unit
(** Execute tests and report results.

    [execute_all s ts] executes all tests in the list [ts] in unspecified order and records the result of each test in
   [s]. *)

val main :
  Test.t list -> unit
(** Define the program entry point given a list of tests.

    This is an alternative to running {! execute_all} manually. *)
