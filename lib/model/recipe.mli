(** Descriptions of dependencies for C++ projects.

    We use the word "recipe" to describe the inter-dependencies of C++ projects (which we call "ingredients"). *)

open Rresult

(** A raw recipe describes a C++ project which has no dependencies. *)
type raw

(** A cooked recipe describes a C++ project which itself depends on other projects (it is an "ingredient" for other
   recipe which has to be "cooked" before it can be used). *)
type cooked

(** A recipe can either describe a raw or cooked ingredient. *)
type t =
  | Raw of raw
  | Cooked of cooked

(** {2 Names} *)

(** Recipes are identified through their name. *)
type name = string

val compare_name :
  name -> name -> int

val equal_name :
  name -> name -> bool

  | `Already_in_recipe of name
  | `Not_a_direct_dependency of name
  | `Missing_actual_dependencies of name list
]

(** {2 Writing recipes} *)

val raw :
  name -> raw
(** Describe a recipe for a named ingredient with no dependencies on other ingredients. *)

val blank :
  name -> name list -> cooked
(** Start a recipe for an ingredient which itself requires other ingredients in its preparation.

    [blank d ds] is the start of a recipe with name [d] which has real dependencies on each named ingredient in [ds]. *)

val name :
  t -> name
(** Query for the name of a recipe. *)

val requires :
  raw -> cooked -> cooked result
(** [requires rr cr] indicates that the raw recipe [rr] must be executed as part of the recipe for the cooked recipe
   [cr].

    We say that [cr] has a ""direct dependency"" on [rr].

    If [cr] already includes a requirement on an ingredient with the name of [rr] then the result is an error of
   [`Already_in_recipe]. *)

val prepares :
  cooked -> name list -> cooked -> cooked result
(** [prepares dcr ds cr] indicates that the cooked recipe [dcr] must be executed as part of the recipe for the cooked
   recipe [cr].

    All the ingredients contained in [dcr] are also added to the recipe for [cr], except those indicated by name in the
   list [ds].

    We say that [cr] has a "direct dependency" on [dcr].

    If [cr] already includes a requirement on an ingredient with the name of [dcr] then the result is an error of
   [`Already_in_recipe]. *)

val before :
  name -> name -> cooked -> cooked result
(** [before d1 d2 cr] indicates that a direct dependency of [cr] with name [d1] must be executed before a direct
   dependency of [cr] with name [d2].

    If either [d1] or [d2] refer to ingredients which are not direct dependencies of [cr] then the result is an error of
   [`Not_a_direct_dependency]. *)

(** {2 Executing recipes} *)

(** Restrictions specify limits on which ingredients are actually executed in a recipe. *)
type restrictions = [
  | `Include of name list
  | `Exclude of name list
]

val execute :
  ?restrictions:restrictions -> t -> name list result
(** [execute qs t] executes the recipe [t] with the application of restrictions [qs].

    The result is the order in which ingredients were executed in the recipe (excluding the name of ingredient described
   by the recipe itself). The first name in the list is the first ingredient executed.

    If the recipe is cyclic, then the result is an error of [`Dependency_cycle].

    If an ingredient has actual dependencies that are not satisfied at the time that it is executed, then the result is
   an error of [`Missing_actual_dependencies]. *)

(** {2 Logging} *)

val log_source :
  Logs.src
(** Log source for recipes and their execution. *)
